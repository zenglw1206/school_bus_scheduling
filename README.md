# school_bus_scheduling
Synthetic data set in SBSP paper

In this folder, we provide all 10 randomly generated problem instances (instance 0, instance 1, ..., instance 9) that are used for numerical study in paper "A Bounded Formulation for The School Bus Scheduling Problem".

The route data for instance k (k=0, 1, ..., 9) is store in 'route_set_random_zero_tran_k.csv'. Each row in the csv file corresponds to a route, represented by two entries: the first entry specifies the school id that the route belongs to and the second entry is the travel time of the route.
